Tested:  July 7, 2021, links fixed and working correctly, updated nav bar 7/8/21, still not working correctly
removed the extra </li> from line 41 to see if that would fix the linking problem, but saw no difference.

         <p><h2>Welcome, I'm so glad you're here!</h2></p>
            <p>Thank you for viewing my writing portfolio. You are very welcome to peruse my works of fiction, poetry, and academic writing.</p>
            <p>This collection reflects some of my favorite projects both from the time I spend working on them as well as how I feel they turned out. I have gathered them here for ease of reference and to show my work. My hope is that this collection will appeal to all; from the casual reader to the professionals seeking to hire someone to fill a potential need. Here you will find examples of poetry, prose, academic writing, and an excerpt from a fiction novel that is in the works. They are presented in several formats, allowing the reader to see my versatility in differing genres and mediums. These works represent various points across a ten-year span of time. They are from my heart and it is my greatest desire that you enjoy them.</p>
