            <p>I was still in grade school when I first found out that I could write poetry. I had a large vocabulary thanks to being an avid reader, so I guess it shouldn’t have surprised me that much. One of my poems was put in my 7th grade yearbook, and when I graduated, I was asked to write the senior class poem. It also was put in a yearbook. Looking back now, I realize that other people thought of me as a writer long before I did.</p>
            <p>I was also able to write in other genres as well. I loved writing research papers for high school, which translated into enjoying writing in college when I finally went, almost thirty years later. Both my undergraduate and my graduate degrees were in English with an emphasis in writing. During this time, I was able to practice at prose, poetry, and multiple kinds of academic writing, and I loved them all. Granted, some came easier to me than others, but I found it very fulfilling to get to experience each one.</p>
            <p>I also found that when in class, I was with a community of fellow writers, and that was a gift as well. It was around this time that I became friends with a fellow writer and over time she shared her beautiful poetry with me, and welcomed my work as well. These relationships nurtured my creative work, and taught me the value of creative criticism. Positive peer pressure played a role in my development as well.</p>
            <p>I have found my writing to be therapeutic, the poetry helping me through the process of grief when my husband passed away, and when I dealt with various health issues. I have used the ability to write as a way to reach out to others with my disability activism, something that gives me great pride to be able to participate in. In my novel I have written scenes that I have lived already or hope to someday live in the future. Writing has given me hope and solace, laughter and darkness, outrage and pride. It is my hope that, perhaps, someone will feel a connection, on some level, to what I write and that I might bring happiness to others through my work.</p>
            <p>In going back to college as a non-traditional student, I realized that I wanted to share my love of writing with other non-trads, so it is to that end that I hope to someday teach first-year compostion geared specifically for non-traditional students and our unique needs. Of course, I plan to still write prose and poetry as well. I think that is in my blood and I couldn't escape it even if I wanted to.</p>>
