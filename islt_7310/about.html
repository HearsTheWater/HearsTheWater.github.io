School/Term:  MIZZOU Summer 21

Developed: July 3, 2021

Tested:  July 7th, 2021 finally fixed! Updated nav bar lists 7/8/21 Still not working right
July 16, 2021 adjusting for Mod 5 activity using grids, adding image and changing the stylesheet for colors and fonts
copy and paste from example. Fixed the drop down issue. Remmoved the extra html and css, changed the files as well.
July 19, changed to nav2.css in the hopes that this new stylesheet would help. It didn't. Not sure if I did the nave sheet right.

                 <p>In 1986 I graduated from high school in Miami OK, and remain a loyal <em>Wardog</em> to this day. Following high school, I went to work in my family’s bridal store and eventually became a registered bridal consultant and event planner. By this point, I had been blessed with three children and decided to devote myself to them fully, so for the next ten years I was a stay-at-home mom. Once they were in their teens, I decided to pursue my college education, so I received my Bachelors of Science degree in English (with a writing emphasis) in 2016 from Drury University in Springfield, Missouri, my Masters of Arts in English (with a writing emphasis) from the University of Nebraska Kearney, in the spring of 2021, and am <em>currently</em> working on a graduate certificate in online education at the University of Missouri.<br /><blockquote>“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the <strong>LORD</strong>, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” Jeremiah 29:11</blockquote></p>
