                 <h3>About Me</h3>

<p>In 1986 I graduated from high school in Miami OK, and remain a loyal <em>Wardog</em> to this day. Following high school, I went to work in my family’s bridal store and eventually became a registered bridal consultant and event planner. By this point, I had been blessed with three children and decided to devote myself to them fully, so for the next ten years I was a stay-at-home mom. Once they were in their teens, I decided to pursue my college education, so I received my Bachelors of Science degree in English (with a writing emphasis) in 2016 from Drury University in Springfield, Missouri, my Masters of Arts in English (with a writing emphasis) from the University of Nebraska Kearney, in the spring of 2021, and am <em>currently</em> working on a graduate certificate in online education at the University of Missouri.<br /><blockquote>“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the <strong>LORD</strong>, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” Jeremiah 29:11</blockquote></p>
