     My name is Deborah Seely, but I mostly go by Deb. Given that I have three adult kids (one son and two daughters) and one grandson, I also answer to “Mom” and “Granny-Deb.” I live in southwestern Missouri, in the Ozarks. I am a writer, educator, and disability activist. I went to college when I was in my mid-forties and fifties. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for enabling and encouraging my fellow non-traditional students. The closest thing to web development I have is when I used Wix to set up various sites for school (deborahlseely.com) and for disability activism. I hope to learn, from this course, how to not be so intimidated by creating websites and coding. I read a lot of fition to unwind, and watch way too much TV on my computer, so I guess those could qualify as hobbies, right?
